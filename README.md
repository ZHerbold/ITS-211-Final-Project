# **HOW TO INSTALL AND SET UP PYTHON**

From the python wiki: On many systems Python comes pre-installed, you can try running the python command to start the Python interpreter to check and see if it is already installed. 
On windows you can try the py command which is a launcher which is more likely to work. If it is installed you will see a response which will include the version number
EXAMPLE: Python 3.9.6 (tags/v3.9.6:db3ff76, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

If above example does not appear, you need to install python on your system.

You can download python from here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# **ABOUT**
This program was written by Zander Herbold
This program was written for Fall 2025 ITS 211's Final Project
To run this program, install all .py files (main.py, player.py, enemy.py, floor.py, and customerrors.py) and make sure you have python installed

This project is a simple text based game where you, the player, will fight monsters in a tower.
Everytime you beat all of the enemies on a floor, you will gain experience and move to the next floor
The player wins after beating the boss floor (Floor 10)
This game has two save files, one for the player's info and another for the tower info.
*There is no autosave so make sure to quit properly*

This program was written to demonstrate Zander Herbold's understanding of OOP, modules, file I/O, error handling, and python fundamentals

The proposal of this project can be found here: [Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17pAjdDT7lbv4gHvbbwltwdBfE3rNMzMZOnLfvYtejhs/edit?usp=sharing)
